## Vim configuration

**Vim version: 7.4**

This is my vim configuration repository to help me qucik start vim configuration.
It contains following files and scripts:

- vimrc: vim configuration file

To manage vim plugins I use `vim-plug`:

### Usage
git clone or copy the vimrc file to local as `~/.vimrc`, then start Vim as normal.
